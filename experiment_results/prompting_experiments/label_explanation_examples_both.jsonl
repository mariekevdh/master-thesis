Steven Rose might not be the most neutral commentator on R&I but his review of that book was published in The Lancet Andrew Winston also reviewed that book and said \"But Buchanan has succeeded beautifully and Playing with Fire is an outstanding scholarly achievement\" in  William H Tucker also reviewed it in Isis (journal) and said \"Buchanan's treatment of his subject is commendably evenhanded\" Yet another review is  Nassir Ghaemi also reviewed it and wrote \"this biography does justice to him\"   Why does the article on Eysencks need to be written from Chris Brand's POV?
