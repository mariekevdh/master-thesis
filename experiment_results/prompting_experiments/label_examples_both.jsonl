There is no real justification for it On the other hand if a team tends to play teams within its own division more frequently than those outside their division then even if a first place team has a worse record than a second-place team in another division you can at least argue that it deserves to go into the playoffs as a divisonal representative because intradivisional play figured prominantly into its record as a first place team So given that I don't actually think that it makes sense to say that the divisional championships were necessarily meaningful if every team had an identical schedule<|end|><|assistant|>","TRUE":"no","output":"Yes.","pred_labels":"yes"}

You will be provided with the title and first comment of the discussion. Based on this excerpt, answer 'yes' if it is, answer 'no' if it is not. Examples of when your answer should be 'yes' are when the primary focus is on the verification of facts, the accuracy of the content from the associated Wikipedia article, the correction or identification of incorrect content, the validity or absence of sources or similar concepts. Examples of when your answer should be 'no' are when the discussion does not focus on these aspects, but for example on writing style, adding content, potential bias, content organization, general commentary, technical issues such as broken links, etc. Also classify as 'No' if the discussion lacks sufficient context for a clear classification or if the content does not make sense.\n\nResponse Template:\nYes\/No.\n\nDiscussion Excerpt:\nProblems with this article\nMany of the issues that have been raised on this talk page in the last week were already resolved in this version of the article Specifically:* In that version claims of an affinity by Arab nationalists to Nazism was carefully attributed General statements like \"Arab nationalists in the 1930s and early 1940s were admirers of Nazism\" were eschewed* Claims that Mein Kampf achieved bestseller status in the Palestinian territories all seem to stem from the same report - a report in Hayat El Jedida the official newspaper of the Palestinian National Authority which has since been completely blown out of proportion The version I point to attributes the report to the original source and reports it accurately* The claims by Golda Meir and Dalin about Egyptian soldiers carrying Mein Kampf while of dubious reliability are still worthy of inclusion because at least Golda Meir is an important person and things she said should probably not be ignored In that version of the article the quotes appeared in a context which allowed to reader to decide on the reliability of the statementsThe arguments on this talk page suggest that some of the editors here are motivated by ideological positions regarding the Middle East conflict Yet many of the changes that have been introduced to the article do not even obliquely support one side or the other but simply serve to obfuscate and confuse I therefore urge editors to reconsider their positions and their edits Regards<|end|><|assistant|>","TRUE":"yes","output":"Yes.","pred_labels":"yes"}

Steven Rose might not be the most neutral commentator on R&I but his review of that book was published in The Lancet Andrew Winston also reviewed that book and said \"But Buchanan has succeeded beautifully and Playing with Fire is an outstanding scholarly achievement\" in  William H Tucker also reviewed it in Isis (journal) and said \"Buchanan's treatment of his subject is commendably evenhanded\" Yet another review is  Nassir Ghaemi also reviewed it and wrote \"this biography does justice to him\"   Why does the article on Eysencks need to be written from Chris Brand's POV? Because transforming this biography into an article about the book would be silly I'm going to remove Brand's opinions about the book as wp:undue You're welcome to create a balanced article about Buchanan's biography not WP:COATRACK this one<|end|><|assistant|>","TRUE":"no","output":"Yes.","pred_labels":"yes"}
