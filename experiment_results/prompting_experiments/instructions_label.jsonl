There is no real justification for it On the other hand if a team tends to play teams within its own division more frequently than those outside their division then even if a first place team has a worse record than a second-place team in another division you can at least argue that it deserves to go into the playoffs as a divisonal representative because intradivisional play figured prominantly into its record as a first place team So given that I don't actually think that it makes sense to say that the divisional championships were necessarily meaningful if every team had an identical schedule<|end|><|assistant|>","TRUE":"no","output":"No.","pred_labels":"no"}
