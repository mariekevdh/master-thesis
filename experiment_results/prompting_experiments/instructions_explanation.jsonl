There is no real justification for it On the other hand if a team tends to play teams within its own division more frequently than those outside their division then even if a first place team has a worse record than a second-place team in another division you can at least argue that it deserves to go into the playoffs as a divisonal representative because intradivisional play figured prominantly into its record as a first place team So given that I don't actually think that it makes sense to say that the divisional championships were necessarily meaningful if every team had an identical schedule<|end|><|assistant|>","TRUE":"no","output":"No. Explanation: The discussion primarily revolves around the implications and fairness of the scheduling format in the context of the meaningfulness of division championships.

Steven Rose might not be the most neutral commentator on R&I but his review of that book was published in The Lancet Andrew Winston also reviewed that book and said \"But Buchanan has succeeded beautifully and Playing with Fire is an outstanding scholarly achievement\" in  William H Tucker also reviewed it in Isis (journal) and said \"Buchanan's treatment of his subject is commendably evenhanded\" Yet another review is  Nassir Ghaemi also reviewed it and wrote \"this biography does justice to him\"   Why does the article on Eysencks need to be written from Chris Brand's POV? Because transforming this biography into an article about the book would be silly I'm going to remove Brand's opinions about the book as wp:undue You're welcome to create a balanced article about Buchanan's biography not WP:COATRACK this one<|end|><|assistant|>","TRUE":"no","output":"No. Explanation: The discussion primarily revolves around the concern of giving undue weight to Chris Brand's opinions in the Wikipedia article about Eysencks' 2010 OUP biography.
